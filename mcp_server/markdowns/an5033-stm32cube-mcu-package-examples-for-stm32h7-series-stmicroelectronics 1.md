# 2 STM32CubeH7 examples

The examples are classified depending on the STM32Cube level they apply to. They are named as follows:

Examples: these examples use only the HAL and BSP drivers (middleware components not used). Their ojective is to demonstrate the product/peripherals features andusage. They are organized per peripheral (one folder per peripheral, e.g. TIM). Their complexity level ranges from the basic usage of a given peripheral (.. PWM generation using timer) to the integration of several peripherals .g. how to us DAC for signal generation with synchronization from TIM6 and DMA). The usage of the board resources is reduced to the strict minimum.

Examples_LL: these examples use only the LL drivers (HAL and middleware components not used). They offer an optimum implementation of typical use cases of the peripheral features and configuration procedures. The examples are organized per peripheral (a folder for each peripheral, such as TIM).

Examples_MIX: these examples use both HAL and LL drivers. They offer an optimum implementation of typical use cases f the peripheral features and configuration procedures.The examples are organize per peripheral (a folder for each peripheral, such as DMA2D).

Applications: the applications demonstrate the product performance and how to use the available mdleware stacks.They are organized either by midleware (a folder permideware, e.US Host)r y atura qu-vrikudTetatinatns several middleware stacks is also supported.

Demonstrations: the demonstrations aim at integrating and running the maximum number of peripherals and middleware stacks to showcase the product features and performance.

Template projects: the template projects are provided to allow the user to quickly build a firmware application on a given board:

Templates for boards based on single-core STM32H7 microcontrollers (STM32H743I-EVAL, NUCLEOH743ZI, STM32H7B3I-EVAL, STM32H7B3I-DK, STM32H735G-DK, NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q and NUCLEO-H723ZG): STM32CubeH7 contains one HAL and one LL template projects.

Templates for boards based on dual-core STM32H7 microcontrollers (NUCLEO-H745ZI-Q, STM32H45I-DISCO, STM32H747I-DISCO and STM32H747I-EVAL):

One LL template project

0 Four HAL template projects:

• BootCM4_CM7:

• The Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Cortex®-M4 cores are both running from different Flash memory banks. The system configuration is performed by the Arm® Cortex®-M7. The Arm® Cortex®-M4 cores enters Stop mode after boot, and is then woken up by Arm® Cortex®-M7 using a hardware semaphore.

BootCM7_CM4Gated:

The Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot is gated using Flash memory option bytes.   
The Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Cortex®-M4 cores are both running from diferent Flash memory banks.   
The Arm® Cortex®-M7 core boots, performs the system configuration, and then enables Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot through the RCC.

• BootCM4_CM7Gated:

The Arm® Cortex®-M7 boot is gated using Flash memory option bytes.   
The Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Cortex®-M4 cores are both running from different Flash memory banks.   
The Cortex®-M4 core boots , performs the system configuration, and then enables the Cortex®-M7 boot through the RCC.

BootCM7_CM4Gated_RAM:

The Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot is gated using Flash memory option bytes.   
The Arm® Cortex®-M7 core and Arm® Cortex®-M4 core run from Flash memory bank 1   
and from the D2 SRAM, respectively.   
The Arm® Cortex®-M7 core performs the following actions at boot time: system configuration loading of the Arm® Cortex®-M4 code into the D2 SRAM change of the Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot address and then enabling of Cortex®-M4 boot (through the RCC)

Template for the STM32H750B-DK board based on Value line STM32H7 microcontrollers:

ExtMem_Boot: reference boot code with execution from internal Flash memory. It configures external memories, and then jumps to the user application located in an external memory. Two use cases are possible, XiP and BootROM:

XiP: this use case is intended for eXecution in Place from external Flash memory   
(QUADSPl). In this case, the user application code shall be linked with the target execution memory address in external Quad-SPI Flash memory.   
BootROM: this use case demonstrates how to boot from internal Flash memory, configure the external SDRAM, copy user application binary from the SDMMC Flash memory or from Quad-SPI Flash memory to the external SDRAM, and then jump to the user application. In this case, the user application code shall be linked with the target execution memory address in external SDRAM.

Template_Project: typical template with execution from external memory. Different configurations are available depending on the external memory boot capabilities:

• XiP from QUADSPI, data in internal SRAM

XiP from QUADSPI, data in external SDRAM BootROM: execution from external SDRAM, data in internal SRAM

Section contains the list of examples provided with STM32CubeH7 MCU Package:

Examples for boards based on single-core STM32H7 microcontrollers (STM32H743I-EVAL, NUCLEO-H743ZI, STM32H750B-DK, STM32H7B3I-EVAL, STM32H7B3I-DK, STM32H735G-DK, NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q and NUCLEO-H723ZG)

The STM32CubeH7 MCU Package contains one target project configuration per workspace (Arm® Cortex® M7 core). All single-core examples have the same structure:

Vnc folder that contains all header files.   
ISrc folder for the sources code.   
IEWARM, IMDK-ARM and ISW4STM32 (STM32H743I-EVAL, NUCLEO-H743ZI, STM32H750B-DK), ISTM32CubeIDE (STM32H7B3I-EVAL, STM32H7B3I-DK, STM32H735G-DK, NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q, NUCLEO-H723ZG) folders that contain the preconfigured project for each toolchain.   
A readme.txt file describing the example behavior and the environment required to run the example.

Examples for boards based on dual-core STM32H7 microcontrollers (NUCLEO-H745ZI-Q, STM32H745I-DISCO, STM32H747I-DISCO and STM32H747I-EVAL ):

The STM32CubeH7 MCU Package contains two target project configurations per workspace (one per core), named STM32H7xyl_XXX_CM7 and STM32H7xyl_XXX_CM4. The projects can be configured individually bng the folowig optns targetmioontrolle, ikeroptis, read-only (RO) andread/wri (RW) zones, and preprocessor symbols (CORE_CM4, CORE_CM7). This allows compiling user code linked and programmed separately for each core and generating two binaries: CM7 and CM4.

The examples are structured as follows:

Common drivers files, used both for Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Arm® Cortex®-M4 cores, and including:

o CMSIS core files o CMSIS device files o HAL driver files o BSP files

IEWARM, MDK-ARM and ISW4STM32 folders containing the preconfigured projects   
One ISrc and Vnc folder per core.   
A ICommon folder hosting system and shared source files both for Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Arm® Cortex®-M4 cores.   
A readme.txt file describing the example behavior and the environment required to run the example

Figure 3. STM32CubeH7 project workspaces

To run the example, proceed as follows:

1. For single-core project examples (such as STM32H743I-EVAL board)

a. Browse to \IProjectsIISTM32H743I-EVAL|Examples.   
b. Open IIGPIO, then the IIGPIO_EXTI folder.   
C. Open the project using your preferred toolchain.   
d. Rebuild allfiles and load your image into the target memory.   
e. Run the example: each time you press the Tamper push-button, LED1 toggles (for more details, refer to the example readme.txt file).

2. For dual-core project examples (such as STM32H747I-EVAL board):

a. Browse to ||ProjectsIISTM32H747I-EVAL|Examples.   
b. Open IIGPIO, then the IIGPIO_EXTI folder.   
C Open the project using your preferred toolchain   
d. For each target STM32H747I_EVAL_CM4 and STM32H747I_EVAL_CM7 (based on Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Cortex®-M4, respectively): i. Rebuild al files and load your image into the target memory. ii. After loading the two images, reset the board in order to boot CPU1 (Cortex®-M7) and CPU2 (Cortex®-M4) at once. iiI. Each time you press the Tamper push-button: 1. LED1 toggles once when an EXTI interrupt for Cortex®-M7 is detected. 2. LED3 toggles once when an EXTI interrupt for Cortex®-M4 is detected.

For more details, refer to the example readme.txt file.

3. For Value line project example running on STM32H750B-DK board:

b Open the ExtMem_Boot project with your preferred toolchain.   
C Rebuild allfiles and load your image into the target internal Flash memory.   
d. Browse to IIProjectsIISTM32H750B-DK1Examples.   
e. Open IIGPIO, then the IIGPIO_IOToggle folder.   
f. Open the project using your preferred toolchain (keep the XIP_QSPI_InternalSRAM default configuration).   
g. Rebuild all files and load your image into the external Quad-SPI Flash memory.   
h. Run the example: LED1 toggles continuously (for more details, refer to the example readme.txt fi

Note:

The principle of the STM32H750xx Value line application is to execute the userapplication from an external memory (Quad-SPI Flash memory by default or SDRAM). The Templates|ExtMem_Boot projects boot from the STM32H750xx internal Flash memory, configure external memories and then jump to the user application hosted in an external memory of the STM32H750B-DK board.
